# Enable multi-factor authentication


**Applies To**

-   Partner Center

Microsoft is introducing a secure, scalable framework for authenticating cloud solution provider (CSP) partners and control panel vendors (CPV) through the Microsoft Azure multi-factor authentication (MFA) architecture. You can rely on the new model to elevate security for Partner Center API integration calls. This will help all parties including Microsoft, CSP partners, and control panel vendors to protect their infrastructure and customer data from security risks.


## <span id="scope"></span><span id="SCOPE"></span>Scope

This topic concerns the following actors:

- Control panel vendors (CPV) - A control panel vendor is an independent software vendor that develops apps for use by CSP partners to integrate with Partner Center APIs. A control panel vendor is not a CSP partner with direct access to the Partner dashboard or APIs.
- CSP indirect providers and CSP direct partners who are using app ID + user authentication and directly integrate with Partner Center APIs.
