# Create an Azure plan

Applies to:

* Partner Center

You can create an Azure plan using the Partner Center APIs. The process is similar to creating a Microsoft Azure subscription (**MS-AZR-0145P**). You must [get the catalog item for the Azure plan](#get-the-catalog-item-for-an-azure-plan), then [create and submit an order](#create-and-submit-an-order).

## Prerequisites

* [Partner Center authentication](partner-center-authentication.md) credentials. This scenario supports authentication with both standalone App and App+User credentials.
* The customer identifier. If you don't have a customer's identifier, sign in to Partner Center, choose the customer from the customers list, select **Account**, then save their **Microsoft ID**.
* [Confirmation of the customer's acceptance of the Microsoft Customer Agreement](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/confirm-customer-agreement).

## Get the catalog item for Azure plan

Before you can create an Azure plan for a customer, you need to retrieve the corresponding catalog item. You can retrieve the catalog item using the existing Partner Center catalog APIs with the following resource models.
* **[Product](product-resources.md#product)**: A grouping construct for purchasable goods or services. A product itself is not a purchasable item.
* **[SKU](product-resources.md#sku)**: A purchasable Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) under a product. These represent the different shapes of the product.
* **[Availability](product-resources.md#availability)**: A configuration in which a SKU is available for purchase (such as country, currency or industry segment).

To obtain the catalog item for an Azure plan, complete the following steps:
1. Identify and retrieve the *product* for Azure plan using [Get a list of products](get-a-list-of-products.md) and specifying *targetView* as *Azure*. If you already know the product ID for Azure plan, you can use [Get a product using the product ID](get-a-product-by-id.md) instead.

2. Retrieve the *SKU* from the product for Azure plan using [Get a list of SKUs for a product](get-a-list-of-skus-for-a-product.md). If you already know the SKU ID for Azure plan, you can use [Get a SKU using the SKU ID](get-a-sku-by-id.md) instead.

3. Retrieve the *availability* from the SKU for Azure plan using [Get a list of availabilities for a SKU](get-a-list-of-availabilities-for-a-sku.md). If you already know the Availability ID for the availability you need, you can use [Get an availability using the availability ID](get-an-availability-by-id.md) instead. Take note of its **CatalogItemId** property of the availability for Azure plan. You will need it to create an order.

## Create and submit an order

To submit your order for Azure plan, do the following:
1. [Create a cart](create-a-cart.md) to hold the collection of catalog items that you intend to buy. When you create a [cart](cart-resources.md#cart), the [cart line items](cart-resources.md#cartlineitem) are automatically grouped based on what can be purchased together in the same [order](order-resources.md#order). (You can also [update a cart](update-a-cart.md).)

2. [Check out the cart](checkout-a-cart.md), which results in the creation of an [order](order-resources.md#order).

## Get order details
You can [retrieve the details of an individual order using the order ID](get-an-order-by-id.md). You can also [retrieve a list of all orders for a specific customer](get-all-of-a-customer-s-orders.md).

>[!NOTE]
>After an order is submitted, there is a delay of up to 15 minutes before the order appears in that customer's order list.

## Get Azure plan
After the order is successfully processed, a Partner Center Subscription resource will be created for the Azure plan. You can access the Azure plan using the following methods for managing Partner Center Subscription resources* [Get a customer's subscriptions](get-all-of-a-customer-s-subscriptions.md)
* [Get a list of subscriptions by order](get-a-list-of-subscriptions-by-order.md)

## Lifecycle management
You can suspend an existing Azure plan using the following method:
* [Suspend a subscription](suspend-a-subscription.md)

>You can only suspend an existing Azure plan if it no longer has any active usage assets associated with it, including Azure usage subscriptions and Azure reservations. For details on how to disable Azure usage subscription, refer to [Azure API on subscription lifecycle management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/resources/subscriptions). To remove existing Azure reservations, you must submit a [cancellation request](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/azure-reservations-manage#cancel-or-exchange-a-reservation). Once an Azure plan is suspended, you cannot reactivate it.

## Upgrade from Microsoft Azure (MS-AZR-0145P) to Azure plan
You cannot create Azure plan for an existing customer with Azure Usage subscriptions (MS-AZR-0145P).
â€ƒ
## Azure spending

You can track [Azure spending](azure-spending.md) by querying for usage summary and detailed usage records using the following methods:
* [Get partner usage summary](get-a-partner-usage-summary.md)
* [Get all customer usage records for a partner](get-a-customer-s-usage-records.md)
* [Get customer usage summary](get-a-customer-usage-summary.md)
* [Get all subscription usage records for a customer](get-a-customer-subscription-s-usage-records.md)
* [Get subscription usage summary](get-a-customer-subscription-usage-summary.md)
* [Get all monthly usage records for a subscription](get-all-monthly-usage-records-for-a-subscription.md)
* [Get usage data for subscription by resource](get-a-customer-subscription-resource-usage-records.md)
* [Get usage data for subscription by meter](get-a-customer-subscription-meter-usage-records.md)
* [Get meter usage record resources](meter-usage-resources.md)
* [Get resource usage record resources](resource-usage-resources.md)
You can also set and manage customer usage budget using the following methods:
* [Get customer usage budget](get-a-customer-s-usage-spending-budget.md)
* [Update customer usage budget](update-a-customer-s-usage-spending-budget.md)

## Invoice and reconciliation

You can manage invoices and reconciliation data using the following methods:
- [Get a collection of invoices](get-a-collection-of-invoices.md)
- [Get invoice estimate links](get-invoice-estimate-links.md)
- [Get invoice by ID](get-invoice-by-id.md)
- [Get invoice statement](get-invoice-statement.md) 
- [Get invoice summaries](get-invoice-summaries.md)
- [Get invoice billed consumption line items](get-invoice-billed-consumption-lineitems.md)
- [Get invoice unbilled consumption line items](get-invoice-unbilled-consumption-lineitems.md)
- [Get invoice billed recon line items](get-invoiceline-items.md)
- [Get invoice unbilled recon line items](get-invoice-unbilled-recon-lineitems.md)
