# Azure Rate Card


**Applies To**

-   Partner Center
-   Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud Germany
-   Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud for US Government

The Azure Rate Card provides real-time prices for Azure offers. Azure
pricing is quite dynamic and changes frequently. Microsoft publishes
updates on Partner Center, but the REST API provides the fastest way for
Cloud Solution Provider partners to get current prices.

To track usage and help predict your monthly bill and the bills for
individual customers, you can combine a Rate Card query to [Get prices
for Microsoft Azure](get-prices-for-microsoft-azure.md) with a request
to [Get a customer's utilization records for
Azure](get-a-customer-s-utilization-record-for-azure.md).

Prices differ by market and currency, and this API takes location into
consideration. By default, it uses your partner profile settings in
Partner Center and your browser language, but those are customizable.
This is especially relevant if you manage sales in multiple markets from
a single, centralized office.
