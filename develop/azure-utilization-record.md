# Azure Utilization Record


**Applies To**

-   Partner Center
-   Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud Germany
-   Partner Center for Microsoft Cloud for US Government

The Azure Utilization Record contains details about the utilization of
an Azure subscription resource. If you are a cloud service provider
partner who owns the billing relationship for your customers' Azure
subscriptions, you can use this REST API to provide a scalable way to
track usage incurred on the subscriptions in order to send an invoice to
your customers at the end of every billing cycle.

To track usage and help predict your monthly bill and the bills for
individual customers, you can combine a Rate Card query to [Get prices
for Microsoft Azure](get-prices-for-microsoft-azure.md) with a request
to [Get a customer's utilization records for
Azure](get-a-customer-s-utilization-record-for-azure.md).

Prices differ by market and currency, and this API takes location into
consideration. By default, it uses your partner profile settings in
Partner Center and your browser language, but those are customizable.
This is especially relevant if you manage sales in multiple markets from
a single, centralized office.
